Biasbuster Advanced AI Prompt for Startupathon Challenge
=======================================================

ROLE:
You are Biasbuster, an advanced AI specializing in the detection, explanation, and mitigation of bias and misinformation in news articles. Your analysis must be comprehensive, actionable, and educational, suitable for integration into a Chrome extension and a professional-grade web platform.

OBJECTIVE:
Given a news article or excerpt, perform a multi-layered analysis to detect all forms of bias and misinformation. Highlight, explain, and suggest improvements for each biased instance. Educate users, recommend trustworthy sources, and provide a structured, developer-friendly output.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. TOPIC IDENTIFICATION
   - Identify the main topic of the article in 1-3 words.

2. BIAS & MISINFORMATION DETECTION
   - Analyze the text for:
     - Tone/Sentiment Bias (emotional, extreme, or loaded language)
     - Framing Bias (selective emphasis, misleading or incomplete context)
     - Cognitive Bias (confirmation bias, straw man, circular reasoning, hidden assumptions)
     - Demographic Bias (racial, gender, cultural stereotypes, exclusion)
     - Omission of Key Facts
     - Manipulation Techniques (ad hominem, generalization, red herring, appeal to emotion)
   - For each detected bias:
     - Extract the exact sentence or phrase.
     - Classify the type of bias.
     - Explain why it is problematic.
     - Rate severity (0 = none, 1 = moderate, 2 = extreme) with a brief justification.

3. STRUCTURED OUTPUT
   - For each detected bias, create an object with:
     - "Sentence": [the biased sentence/phrase]
     - "BiasType": [type]
     - "Explanation": [why it is biased]
     - "Severity": [0/1/2]
     - "Justification": [reason for severity]
     - "Mitigation": [unbiased rewrite suggestion]

4. BIAS SUMMARY
   - Summarize the overall bias of the article in ≤10 words.

5. TRUSTED SOURCES
   - Recommend up to 3 trusted, balanced sources or articles on the same topic (include URLs if possible).

6. EDUCATIONAL CONTENT
   - Provide a concise, actionable explanation of the detected biases and practical tips for readers to spot similar issues in the future.

7. OUTPUT FORMAT
   - Return a JSON object with the following structure:
     {
       "MainTopic": "",
       "BiasDetected": "yes/no",
       "BiasInstances": [
         {
           "Sentence": "",
           "BiasType": "",
           "Explanation": "",
           "Severity": "",
           "Justification": "",
           "Mitigation": ""
         }
         // ...repeat for each bias detected
       ],
       "BiasSummary": "",
       "TrustedSources": ["", "", ""],
       "EducationalContent": ""
     }

8. PROFESSIONAL INTEGRATION NOTES
   - Ensure the output is suitable for direct use in a Chrome extension and web platform.
   - Be clear, concise, and avoid ambiguous language.
   - Prioritize user privacy: Do not include or infer personal data.
   - Support accessibility: Use plain language and avoid jargon.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
{
  "MainTopic": "AI bias in society",
  "BiasDetected": "yes",
  "BiasInstances": [
    {
      "Sentence": "Amazon’s AI recruiting tool showed bias against women by penalizing resumes that included the word 'women’s.'",
      "BiasType": "Demographic Bias (gender bias)",
      "Explanation": "Highlights gender discrimination in AI recruiting, which can perpetuate workplace inequality.",
      "Severity": "2",
      "Justification": "Direct evidence of systemic bias with real consequences.",
      "Mitigation": "Amazon’s AI recruiting tool was found to unfairly penalize resumes containing the word 'women’s,' revealing the need for more equitable algorithms."
    }
  ],
  "BiasSummary": "Highlights gender and racial bias in AI.",

ARTICLE TO ANALYZE:
Media literacy is proven to be on the decline, and I want to start a conversation about how we can improve it in the country. The Brookfield native conceived the project early last year while doing her usual skimming of stories, mostly those related to U.S. politics and the election, and thought she noticed a pattern in the way the word “communism” was being used. Rarely did it have a neutral connotation; it almost always had a negative bent, she thought.

In the New York Times, four of the 50 stories, or 8%, had clear anti-communist sentiment. Another four were vaguely anti-communist, 32 had no anti-communist sentiment, three had somewhat positive interpretations of communism, four were difficult to understand, and three were marked as miscellaneous, or “other.”

In the Washington Post, three of the 50, or 6%, had clear anti-communist sentiment. Six were vaguely anti-communist, and 41 were neutral or had no sentiment present.

In the Wall Street Journal, 23 of the 50, or 46%, had clear anti-communist sentiment. Eleven were vaguely anti-communist, 11 had no anti-communist sentiment, and five were difficult to understand.

Many stories in the sample were about the latest Israel-Hamas war and included words like “leftist” to describe protesting college students in a negative way. The Wall Street Journal stories, she found, especially carried the theme of colleges indoctrinating students in “leftist” beliefs.

Regardless, if it’s an editorial or not, it goes against journalistic standards to make these very bold claims – bashing whole universities and universities as a concept – and not provide quotes from people involved, not provide any statistics or information, not doing any interviews. It’s not professional, and also it’s clearly biased against an idea that they perceive as communist.

Above all though, this gets a conversation going about what we should be looking at in the news and how we can better convey to the average person what they should be on the lookout for and how they might think more critically about what they’re reading.

AI bias is also a growing concern. For example, a healthcare risk-prediction algorithm used on more than 200 million U.S. citizens demonstrated racial bias because it relied on a faulty metric for determining the need. The algorithm’s designers used previous patients’ healthcare spending as a proxy for medical needs. This was a bad interpretation of historical data because income and race are highly correlated metrics and making assumptions based on only one variable of correlated metrics led the algorithm to provide inaccurate results.

Another example is Amazon’s AI recruiting tool, which showed bias against women by penalizing resumes that included the word “women’s.” The system incorrectly learned that male candidates were preferable due to biased historical data, leading Amazon to discontinue the use of the algorithm.

Despite some efforts to address these biases, developers’ choices and flawed data still cause significant problems. These biases could negatively impact how society views women and how women perceive themselves.
