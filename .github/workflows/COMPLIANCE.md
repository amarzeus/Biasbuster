# Biasbuster CI/CD Pipeline Compliance Documentation

This document outlines the compliance and security controls implemented in the Biasbuster CI/CD pipeline.

## Pipeline Overview

The Biasbuster CI/CD pipeline is designed to provide a secure, reliable, and efficient process for building, testing, and deploying the application. The pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and follows industry best practices for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## Security Controls

### Code Scanning

- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Scanning for CVEs in third-party dependencies
- **NPM Audit**: Regular auditing of npm packages for security issues

### Access Controls

- **Branch Protection**: Main branch is protected requiring pull request reviews
- **Required Approvals**: At least one reviewer must approve changes before merge
- **Code Owners**: Specific files and directories have designated owners who must approve changes

### Secrets Management

- **GitHub Secrets**: All sensitive information is stored in GitHub Secrets
- **Environment Secrets**: Deployment credentials are stored as environment-specific secrets
- **Least Privilege**: CI/CD workflows use minimum required permissions

### Build Integrity

- **Immutable Artifacts**: Build artifacts are stored as immutable artifacts in GitHub
- **Build Verification**: Multiple verification steps ensure build integrity
- **Docker Image Signing**: Docker images are signed for authenticity verification

### Deployment Controls

- **Environment Segregation**: Separate environments for development, staging, and production
- **Approval Gates**: Production deployments require explicit approval
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Automated rollback capability for failed deployments
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment health checks to verify successful deployment

## Compliance Standards

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to help maintain compliance with the following standards:

- OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)
- SOC 2 Type II (Security, Availability, and Confidentiality)
- GDPR Technical Requirements

## Audit Trail

- **Deployment Logs**: All deployment actions are logged and stored
- **Change History**: Full history of changes is maintained in Git
- **Notifications**: Success/failure notifications sent to designated channels
- **Release Notes**: Automated generation of release notes

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Automated tests for individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full application flow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Verify application performance meets requirements
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure application is accessible to all users
- **Security Tests**: Validate security controls and requirements

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident or pipeline failure:

1. Automatic notifications are sent to the security team
2. Failed deployments trigger automatic rollback to last known good state
3. Incident details are logged for further analysis
4. Post-incident review is conducted to prevent recurrence

## Continuous Improvement

The CI/CD pipeline is regularly reviewed and updated to incorporate:

- New security best practices
- Improved testing methodologies
- Faster and more reliable deployment strategies
- Enhanced monitoring and notification capabilities

## Responsible Disclosure

Security issues should be reported to security@biasbuster.com or through our responsible disclosure program at https://biasbuster.com/security.
