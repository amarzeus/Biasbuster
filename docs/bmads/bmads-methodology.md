# BMAD Methodology Overview

The Bias Mitigation and Audit Design (BMAD) methodology is a comprehensive framework for developing, auditing, and governing AI systems to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability.

## Core Principles

- **Bias Detection:** Systematic identification of bias in datasets, models, and outputs.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Techniques to reduce or eliminate bias, including preprocessing, in-processing, and post-processing methods.
- **Audit Trails:** Maintaining detailed logs and reports for compliance and transparency.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Incorporating human judgment to review and override AI decisions.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Ongoing evaluation of AI systems to detect drift and emerging biases.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Involving diverse stakeholders in the design and evaluation process.

## BMAD Process Phases

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
   - Identify sensitive attributes
   - Ensure data quality and representativeness

2. **Bias Detection & Measurement**
   - Use statistical and AI fairness metrics
   - Generate bias reports and visualizations

3. **Bias Mitigation**
   - Apply algorithmic fairness techniques
   - Retrain models with balanced data

4. **Audit & Compliance**
   - Generate audit reports
   - Document decisions and actions

5. **Deployment & Monitoring**
   - Monitor model performance and fairness
   - Trigger alerts for anomalies

6. **Human Review & Feedback**
   - Enable user appeals and reviews
   - Incorporate feedback into model updates
