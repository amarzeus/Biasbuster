2. **Processing**
   - NLP analysis
   - Pattern recognition
   - Context evaluation

3. **Results**

   - Confidence scores
   - Improvement suggestions

### Scoring System
- **0-100 Scale**
  - 0-20: Minimal bias
  - 21-40: Moderate bias
  - 41-60: Significant bias
  - 61-80: High bias
  - 81-100: Severe bias

## Using the API

### Endpoints
